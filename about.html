            <p class="p1">Hello! My name is Neema Dadmand. I'm a UI/UX Designer based out of beautiful Vancouver, BC.</p>
        
            <p class="p1">I'm currently working at Incognito Software as a UI/UX designer focussing on Firmware management services. In the last few years I've brought a design centric thinking that improved flows and minimized risk for Network Administrators dealing with over 5 million devices.<</p>
        
       <p class="p1">Besides design, I love photography. On my spare time I like to hit the streets of Vancouver and capture the various communities and the culture that's embedded within them. Automotives is something I've been fond of since childhood. I am a enthusiast of 90's German and Japanese design and engineering, so much that I started out my photography with taking pictures of such cars.</p>

        
        <p class="p1">When I unplug, I enjoy travelling, spending time with friends, and hitting the trails on my bike. </p>
