        </div> Hello! My name is Neema Dadmand. I'm a UI/UX Designer based out of beautiful Vancouver, BC.<br><br>
        
            
            
        I'm currently working at Incognito Software as a UI/UX designer focussing on Firmware management services. In the last few years I've brought a design centric thinking that improved flows and minimized risk for Network Administrators dealing with over 5 million devices.<br><br>
        
       Besides design, I love photography. On my spare time I like to hit the streets of Vancouver and capture the various communities and the culture that's embedded within them. Automotives is something I've been fond of since childhood. I am a enthusiast of 90's German and Japanese design and engineering, so much that I started out my photography with taking pictures of such cars.<br><br>
        
<!--        <p>Competitiveness runs uncontrollably through my blood. I'm an avid PC gamer taking on titles such as Counterstike: Global Offence, Playersunknown: Battlegrounds, Rocket League, etc. I also play tennis  </p>-->
        
        When I unplug, I enjoy travelling, spending time with friends, and hitting the trails on my bike. </p>
